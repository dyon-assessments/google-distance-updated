because of the originally npm module is outdated and has warnings
i updated the package 

!dont use this if the originally package is updated!

updated google distance module that originally is developed by : 
https://github.com/edwlook/node-google-distance/commits?author=edwlook


more information and documentation on : 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-distance


the only difference is the way of import the module 
instead of  
var distance = require('google-distance');


you now import like this :

var distance = require('google-distance-updated');
