updated google distance module that originally is developed by : 
https://github.com/edwlook/node-google-distance/commits?author=edwlook

more information on : 
https://www.npmjs.com/package/google-distance

the only difference is the way of import the module 
instead of  
var distance = require('google-distance');
you now import like this :
var distance = require('google-distance-updated');
